::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Describe your data's intended audience and their needs. 
- Appraise the strengths of different existing standards.
- Understand basic descriptive metadata ethics.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

Who is your intended audience? What are their needs?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this episode we will evaluate different methods to cleanup and enhance your data, all while keeping in mind an ethical obligation to provide inclusive access to information. We will then apply these techniques to our sample data set.

Knowing your audience is the first step to ensure you have adequate data categories. In our spreadsheet we started with typical access points such as title, creator (institutional host), resource type, subject, language, and URL. Then we thought of some of our target audiences. What access points would students, faculty, or other librarians want to search by? So we added more detailed subject analysis with columns such as Country Coverage and Time Period.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge
## Target Audience
Imagine one target audience includes students, teachers, and librarians in Latin America. What kind of metadata might enhance access to your data? (Choose all that apply)

A. Terms in Spanish & Portuguese
B. Country Coverage
C. Resource type

:::::::::::::::  solution

A & B. While A, B, and C are all useful metadata, adding additional columns for subject access in Spanish and Portuguese provides a broader audience the ability to keyword search in multiple languages. And adding the ability to narrow by specific countries, rather than a broader Latin America or by continent, gives the user more precise searching capabilities.

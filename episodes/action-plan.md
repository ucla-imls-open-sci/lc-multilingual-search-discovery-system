Congratulations on developing a search and discovery system for data stored in a Google Sheet! This is an impressive achievement. 

In this episode, you will explore how to expand the impact of your project and encourage participation and collaboration. Let's begin by exploring various strategies to increase the visibility of your project. Think about how you bring people in! How can you effectively promote your website to reach potential users who might find it valuable? While not all of these possibilities may be directly applicable to your specific situation, it's valuable to consider a wide range of options. Use the following checklist to help you identify the most effective ways to promote your project.

## Create Diverse Content about Your Project and Encourage Others to Link to It and Reuse Your Data

* Write a wikipedia entry.
* Allow reuse of your data by selecting a [creative commons license appropriate to your work] (https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/) . Also, share your data with similar projects so that you can reuse their content and they can reuse yours. 
* Encourage librarians to link to your project in:
⋅⋅⋅⋅* E-resources/database finder platforms. Example: [Library of Congress E-Resources Platform](https://eresources.loc.gov/c/fdij6k/database/details/100009828?alphamenufacet=&count=25&highlightTag=mark&offset=1&orderby=relevance&search=lacli&searchField=keyword&searchType=contains&subjectFacetSchemaFilter=library%20of%20congress))
⋅⋅⋅⋅* Library Guides. You can track those created using LibGuides, a content management and information sharing system, in this [website](
  https://community.libguides.com/)
 ....* Suggest other library projects or initiatives to include a metadata record for your project. Example: project LACLI in the [Handbook of Latin American Studies] (https://hlasopac.loc.gov/vwebv/search?searchArg=lacli&searchCode=GKEY%5E*&searchType=0&recCount=25&sk=en_US) and [Resources for College Libraries] (https://www.rclweb.net/) (this database requires a subscription).

## Disseminate Information about Your Project via Listservs of Professional Organizations 

These listservs could be from both library and subject related organizations. In the case of our project LACLI, we promote it in organizations such as the Seminar on the Acquisition of Latin American Library Materials (SALALM), sections of the Latin American Studies Association (LASA), the ACRL’s European Studies Section (WESS), and the National Association to Promote Library and Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish-Speaking (REFORMA). In addition to national and international organizations, consider promoting it in regional and local organizations as well. 

## Build an effective social media strategy 

* Create social media accounts/profiles in those social media services you consider more effective for your intended audience.  At the beginning of your social media strategy, you might need to explore a wider net of social media platforms and narrow them down based on their analytics. For example, Linkedin might be a good option to target professionals across various industries and career stages interested in networking. X (formerly known as Twitter) can be proven effective targeting journalists, media professionals and political activists. Also consider age groups. For example, Instagram is particularly popular among younger users in the 18-29 range; TikTok is heavily used by younger Millennials. Consider the potential of others such as Reddit that is known for its diverse communities and discussions. Reddit is popular among tech-savvy users in their 20s.
* Follow organizations and people related to the subject of your project. Make sure you tag them when you create content related to something of their interest or something that has been created by them. This is a low-maintenance way to start building connections with them by helping promote their own content or share with them related content connected to their interests. For example, in LACLI we create weekly posts featuring sources from our database. If we promote a source created by an organization, we tag it along with tags to potential individual users interested in it. This also expands the visibility of your posts to anyone that follows the account you are tagging.
* Be strategic about the context, nature of the content and when you post it. For example, in LACLI we have featured content related to historical commemorations or celebrations. During the “back to school” period, we have promoted free OER resources. Make sure you use hashtags to increase the visibility of your posts. Also, use at least one hashtag that can bring all the posts related to a specific theme or focus together. For example, in LACLI we use the hashtag #LACLIresources to bring all the resources that we feature together. In terms of content, explore various tones depending on your audience but keep them short and to the point. In the case of LACLI, we focus on the value and uniqueness of each featured resource. When crafting your posts, carefully consider two key language aspects:
Choice of language: Decide whether to write in English, Spanish, or other languages based on your target audience.
Writing style: Adapt your tone and vocabulary to suit your specific readers, whether they're academics, high school teachers, or other groups.
* Promote your project by using hashtags such as #DataScience or #TidyTuesday so others can contribute content to your project or reuse it to create other digital objects such as visualizations. 
* Be aware of the limitations of social media. When you rely solely on social media platforms, you're not necessarily casting the widest possible net for your audience. While some individuals engage deeply with content and actively participate in discussions, many others interact differently. Furthermore, numerous individuals confine their social media use strictly to personal matters, avoiding professional or project-related content entirely. A significant portion of users tend to passively consume content. This passive consumption can limit the meaningful interactions and collaborations you might be hoping to achieve for your project.

It's a common scenario in the social sciences and humanities: that after research teams amass a wealth of texts, videos, and images they then endeavor to make their collection publicly available. Their usual approach involves quickly compiling a spreadsheet or employing some third-party web hosting product (that never truly does what they want) then sharing its URL. 

While well-intentioned, such solutions are difficult to navigate, lack useful metadata, and, without a clear strategy for promotion and sustained engagement, drift into obscurity on the web.

This lesson guides you through creating a lightweight, open-source search and discovery system where users can find, explore, and engage with multilingual research materials. We'll use the Google Sheets API (free) for the backend database and JavaScript (also free) for controlling search and data display on the front-end. 

This lesson is based on the authorsâ€™ experience developing [LACLI](https://lacli.info/), a multilingual search and discovery system for freely available online resources in Latin American, Caribbean, Latinx, and Iberian studies.

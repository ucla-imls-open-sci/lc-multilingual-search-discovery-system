## Web App Starting Files

This lesson provides the basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript files to start up our web app. To get these files:

1. Download this zip file and save it to your Desktop. 
2. Unzip [webapp.zip](https://github.com/ucla-imls-open-sci/lc-multilingual-search-discovery-system/raw/refs/heads/main/episodes/webapp/webapp.zip), which should create a new folder called ```webapp```.

In this episode, you will explore how to expand the impact of your project and encourage participation and collaboration. Let's begin by exploring various strategies to increase the visibility of your project. Think about how you bring people in! How can you effectively promote your website to reach potential users who might find it valuable? While not all of these possibilities may be directly applicable to your specific situation, it's valuable to consider a wide range of options. Use the following checklist to help you identify the most effective ways to promote your project.

## Create Diverse Content about Your Project and Encourage Others to Link to It and Reuse Your Data

* Write a wikipedia entry.
* Allow reuse of your data by selecting a creative commons license appropriate to your work  https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/   Also, share your data with similar projects so that you can reuse their content and they can reuse yours. 
* Encourage librarians to link to your project in:
⋅⋅⋅* E-resources/database finder platforms. Example: Library of Congress E-resources Platform 
⋅⋅⋅* Library Guides. You can track those created using LibGuides, a content management and information sharing system, in this website: https://community.libguides.com/ 
...* Suggest other library projects or initiatives to include a metadata record for your project. Example: project LACLI in the Handbook of Latin American Studies  and Resources for College Libraries (this database requires a subscription).
